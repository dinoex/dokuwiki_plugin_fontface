===== Installation Instructions =====

The used font needs to be uploaded into the plugin's "fonts" directory.
The font files that need to be uploaded depend on the embedding technique you use.

==== @font-face ====

You need four files to accomodate for all different browsers:

  * <fontFile>.eot
  * <fontFile>.woff
  * <fontFile>.ttf
  * <fontFile>.svg

Here you will find ready-made font packages which will already contain all four of them:
